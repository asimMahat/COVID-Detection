# COVID-Detection
# Covid and other pulmonary infections detection from Radiographic image using pytorch and flask

The main objective of this project is to classify the given radiographic (x-ray) image into four categories :
1. Normal
2. Covid
3. Lung Opacity
4. Pneumonia

# Necessary Dependencies 

#### 1. Pytorch
  -> We can install pytorch from its official website "https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/"

#### 2. Flask
  -> Command to install flask
     'pip install flask'
     
You can make virtual environment in your anaconda navigator and install the necessary libarires there. 

A pretrained Resnet architecture is used to train the model. The model is trained on about 22-23 thousand radiographic image.
